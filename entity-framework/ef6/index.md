# Entity Framework 6 Quick Overview
Entity Framework 6 (EF6) is a tried and tested object-relational mapper (O/RM) with many years of features and stabilization.
EF6 enables developers to work with relational data using strongly-typed .NET objects, taking advantage of Language INtegrated Query (LINQ) and services such as automatic change tracking, identity resolution and lazy loading.
EF6 eliminates the need for a large portion of the data access "plumbing" code that they usually need to write, and allows them to focus on their application's business logic.

## Should I use EF6 or EF Core?

EF Core is a more modern, lightweight and extensible version of Entity Framework.
EF Core is a complete rewrite and contains many new features not available in EF6, although it also still lacks some of the most advanced mapping capabilities of EF6.
We recommend using EF Core in new applications as long as the feature set matches your requirements.
See the section [Compare EF Core & EF6](xref:efcore-and-ef6/index) for a detailed explanation of this choice.

## [Get Started](~/ef6/get-started/index.md)

## Past Entity Framework Versions
